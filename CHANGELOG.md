## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Europe v0 is supported.
  Mods still need the 1.3.0 update.
- Up to four controllers work as separate players, with per-player bindings and an option to keep one layout for every player.
- Collision Viewer in the settings debug tab draws solid tiles and actor solids in blue and actor hitboxes in red.
- The Power-up storage mod keeps the power-up you walk into while already powered and shows it in a reserve box. Press Minus to summon it with the red-coin ring reward animation.
- Setup can precompile shaders before you play, with a progress bar.
  You can skip it, and shaders still compile during play.
- Mods can draw a HUD with `nsmbu.Gui` and read controller buttons.

### Changed

- The renderer uses less CPU each frame, so busy scenes and high frame rate settings hold their speed better.
- Mods run on LuaJIT and load `.lua` scripts.
  Luau mods with `.luau` files do not load until the scripts are converted.
- The mod examples and the SDK ship TypeScript source compiled to Lua.
- The install screen keeps the setup log on screen while the game is prepared.
- Setup left-aligns its action buttons.
  The installed menu puts Play next to Quit in the footer.

### Fixed

- The Keys screen takes the disc key and the Wii U common key typed or pasted as 32 hex digits.
  A key file saved by Notepad or a Cemu `keys.txt` works too.
- The game window title shows the game name.
  A development build also shows the frame rate.
